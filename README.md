Two ways to make a word grid.

1. Set the grid size, fill with random letters, use search to identify words.

-- this approach doesn't lend itself to many words. instead of random letters tried frequency dist of letters in words and had similar disapointing results

2. Set the words, computer places them (grid grows as needed), fills rest of grid with random letters

-- add game mode of randomly select words from a dictionary to solve for
